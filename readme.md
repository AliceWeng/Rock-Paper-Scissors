How to Play
1. Press "start."
2. Choose your fighter: "rock", "paper", or "scissors."
    * If you tie, game over.
    * If you win, the game continues.
    * If you lose, the game continues and you're attacked.
    * If the game continues, you enter a battle against the computer.
3. Choose your move: "attack", "defend", or "talk."
    * Each "attack" deals between 1 to 3 damage at random.
    * The computer always chooses to "attack."
    * If your HP reaches 0, you lose.
    * If the computer's HP reaches 0, you win.
    * If you "talk" 3 times without dying, you win.
