Press "start."
Then, you have three options: "rock", "paper", or "scissors."
If you tie, the game ends.
If you win, the game continues.
If you lose, the game continues, and you're attacked.
If the game continues, you enter a battle against the computer.
Then, you have three options: "attack", "defend", or "talk."
The computer always chooses to "attack."
Each "attack" does between 1-3 damage, at random.
If the computer's HP reaches 0, you win.
If your HP reaches 0, you lose.
If you "talk" three times without dying, you win.
