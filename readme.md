How To Play
1. Press "START."
2. You'll have three options: "ROCK", "PAPER", or "SCISSORS."
    * If you tie, the game ends.
    * If you win, the game continues.
    * If you lose, the game continues and you're attacked.
    * If the game continues, you'll enter a battle against the computer.
3. You'll have three options: "ATTACK", "DEFEND", or "TALK."
    * Each "ATTACK" randomly does between 1-3 damage.
    * The computer always chooses to "ATTACK."
    * If your HP reaches 0, you lose.
    * If the computer's HP reaches 0, you win.
    * If you "TALK" three times without dying, you win.
4. Once the game ends, press the text at the top for an easter egg.
